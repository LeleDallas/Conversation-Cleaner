### ❌ The Problem  
When reviewing pull requests (PRs) on GitHub, the timeline is often cluttered with **system messages, status updates, and other non-conversational elements**. This makes it harder to focus on the actual **discussions, feedback, and code reviews**. Scrolling through irrelevant content slows down the review process and reduces efficiency.  

### ✅ The Solution: Conversation-Cleaner  
**Conversation-Cleaner** is a **simple Chrome extension** that helps you **streamline PR reviews** by hiding unnecessary timeline entries, allowing you to focus on what really matters: the **conversations and feedback**.  

### 🛠️ How It Works  
🔹 **Filters Out Noise** – Automatically removes system messages and unrelated comments from the PR timeline.  
🔹 **Enhances Readability** – Provides a cleaner, distraction-free view of discussions.  
🔹 **Improves Efficiency** – Reduces scrolling and helps reviewers find relevant comments faster.  

### 🎯 Why Use It?  
✨ **Stay Focused** – Only see the essential discussions and feedback.  
⚡ **Review Faster** – Spend less time filtering through irrelevant updates.  
🤝 **Collaborate Better** – Follow conversations more clearly and improve team communication.  

This extension is especially useful for **developers and project maintainers** who frequently review PRs and need a **clutter-free** experience🚀
